# Overview

What is the purpose of the Tasks & Tests Registry? There is a lot of custom business logic used today, which requires a lot of custom testing and setup. Generally, when writing a new task, users have to start from ground-zero, writing brand new logic and then figuring out how to properly run it.

What we've found is that there's a lot of overlap in the types of utilities required. Enter the Tasks & Tests Registry; instead of starting from ground-zero every time, you can browse through the list of tasks and tests, and see which ones allow you to get to a finished product the fastest. If you don't find an item that suits you, write a new one and add it in! See the [Contributing](contributing.md) page to see how to add a task or test to the registry.

Here is a list of all the tasks & tests that currently exist:

- [Script Injection](scriptinjection.md)
- [K8S Job](k8sjob.md)

# Overview

What is the purpose of the Tasks & Tests Registry? There is a lot of custom business logic used today, which requires a lot of custom deployment logic, testing and setup. Writing these new tasks from scratch, writing brand new logic and then figuring out how to properly run it can be difficult and massive time sinks.

Enter the Tasks & Tests Registry; instead of starting from scratch every time, you can browse through the list of tasks and tests available and see which ones match your needs. Instead of writing new logic every time, users can greatly speed up the process of writing and being confident in their pipeline setup. If you don't find an item that suits you, write a new one and add it in! See the [Contributing](contributing.md) page to see how to add a task or test to the registry.

Here is a list of all the tasks & tests that currently exist:

- [Injection](scriptinjection.md)
- [K8S Job](k8sjob.md)
- [Argo Workflows](workflows.md)
